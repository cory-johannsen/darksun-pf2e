<a id="top"></a><p>To understand commerce and equipment in Dark Sun, one must understand that Athas is a metalpoor world. In game terms, all metal items-swords, armor, coins -are worth considerably more than on other AD&amp;D®worlds such as Lynn or Oerth.</p><p>Virtually all Athasian city states issue coins minted in tribute to their sorcerer-kings. Also, some in dependent dwarven communities and some wealthy merchant families mint their own coins when the precious metals are available to them. Though the currencies vary (a gold coin minted in Tyr might be a bit heavier than the square gold coins that bear the Ryharian family crest), they all fall under the standard exchange rates given in the <em>Player&#x27;s Handbook.</em>On Athas, 100 cp (ceramic pieces) = 10 sp = 2 ep = 1 gp = 1/5 pp.</p><p id="header-0-ceramic-pieces-and-bits" class="h1-header">I.  <a href="#top" style="font-size: 0.8em; text-decoration: none;">[^]</a> <span style="color: #ca5804">Ceramic Pieces and Bits:</span></p><p>The most commonly used coin throughout Athas is the ceramic piece (cp). Ceramic coins can be manufactured from the most common clay of Athas, then glazed in specific colors and kilned to discourage forgery. The molded shape of ceramic pieces allows them to be broken into 10 separate pie-shaped pieces. Each of these &quot;bits&quot; is worth1/10of a ceramic piece.</p><p id="header-1-what-things-are-worth" class="h1-header">II.  <a href="#top" style="font-size: 0.8em; text-decoration: none;">[^]</a> <span style="color: #ca5804">What Things Are Worth</span></p><p>The equipment lists in the<em>Player&#x27;s Handbook</em> show not only how much each item costs, but what each item is worth in typical AD&amp;D game coinage.</p><p>On Athas, the relative rarity of metal increases the value of metal items. Coins themselves are worth more, so fewer Athasian coins are needed to purchase things that aren&#x27;t made of metal. However, metal items, because of the scarcity of metal coinage, cost relatively the same number of coins as in other worlds. When Dark Sun characters make purchases from the equipment lists in the<em>Player&#x27;s</em> <em>Handbook,</em>therefore, the following rules apply:</p><p>All nonmetal items cost one percent of the price listed.</p><p>All metal items cost the price listed.</p><p>Thus, the small canoe (a nonmetal item) costs 3 sp, but the long sword (a metal item) costs 15 gp.</p><p>If an item is typically a mixture of metal and nonmetal components and the metal components could be replaced easily, the nonmetal price applies. For example, Athasian chariot makers have found ways to avoid using metal parts to make an equally sturdy chariot, so the nonmetal price of 5 gp applies.</p><p>All prices listed in the DARK SUN boxed set or in any other DARK SUN module or accessory already compensate for the rarity of metals. Prices listed in other AD&amp;D game products are not adjusted-the rules of conversion apply for them, as well.</p><p id="header-2-monetary-systems" class="h1-header">III.  <a href="#top" style="font-size: 0.8em; text-decoration: none;">[^]</a> <span style="color: #ca5804">Monetary Systems</span></p><p>Societies on Athas exchange goods and services in three ways: coin, barter, and service.</p><p id="header-3-coin" class="h1-header">IV.  <a href="#top" style="font-size: 0.8em; text-decoration: none;">[^]</a> <span style="color: #ca5804">Coin:</span></p><p>Transactions where goods or services are purchased with money remain quite common on Athas, despite the lack of metals: Athas is metalpoor, not metal-depleted. Coins are a readily accepted means of payment and, considering the increased value of coins, are less bulky to carry around.</p><p id="header-4-barter" class="h2-header"> <a href="#top" style="font-size: 0.8em; text-decoration: none;">[^]</a> <span class="header-h2" style="color: #ca5804; font-size: 0.9em">Barter:</span></p><p>Barter is the exchange of goods for other goods: no coins change hands. By its very nature, barter is an age-old ceremony of negotiation. Characters in Dark Sun can enter either a simple or protracted barter.</p><p id="header-5-simple-barter" class="h2-header"> <a href="#top" style="font-size: 0.8em; text-decoration: none;">[^]</a> <span class="header-h2" style="color: #ca5804; font-size: 0.9em">Simple Barter:</span></p><p>In simple barter, characters compare the costs of the items to be exchanged and then match the quantities until they are approximately even. For example, Kyuln wishes to exchange his crop of rice for a metal bastard sword. On Athas, Kyuln&#x27;s rice is worth 2 bits(2/10cp) per pound, and the metal bastard sword he seeks is worth 25 gp (2500 cp). Kyuln would have to trade 12,500 pounds of his rice (his entire harvest) to the weaponsmith in exchange for his new metal bastard sword. The weaponsmith might not be that hungry.</p><p id="header-6-protracted-barter" class="h2-header"> <a href="#top" style="font-size: 0.8em; text-decoration: none;">[^]</a> <span class="header-h2" style="color: #ca5804; font-size: 0.9em">Protracted Barter:</span></p><p>In protracted barter, dice are thrown and costs recalculated in three separate rounds before a final exchange is made. Because of its complexity, protracted barter works best for items that cost more than 100 gp. For protracted barter, the Charisma scores of the parties involved (usually a player character and nonplayer character controlled by the DM) must be known.</p>
<p>In the first round of protracted barter, each party rolls 2d6 and adds the result to his Charisma score; the higher roll wins the round. The winner has talked down the price of the loser&#x27;s barter item by 10 percent. If either party decides to end the barter, it is finished here. If neither party decides to end the barter, it continues to a second round, and then to a *available only in some city-states **available only in cities with organized militaries third. Protracted barter can last no more than three rounds. Once entered into, a transaction will take place -neither party can back out of a deal once protracted barter has commenced.</p><p>If Kyuln from the previous example (Charisma score of 13) were to enter into protracted barter with the weaponsmith (Charisma score 7), he might get a better or worse deal. In the first round, Kyuln rolls 7 (+13 = 20) and the weapons smith rolls 10 (+7 = 17); Kyuln wins the round. He has talked the weaponsmith down 10 percent, so the metal bastard sword in question is now worth 22 gp and 5 sp. Both men wish to continue into a second round. Kyuln rolls 4 (+13 = 17) and the weapons smith rolls 10 (+7 = 17); the tie means that neither cost is adjusted. In the third and final round, Kyuln rolls a 10 (+13 = 23) and the smith rolls a 7 (+7 = 14); Kyuln wins again. He has talked the weaponsmith down to 20 gp for the metal bastard sword, so must only exchange 10,000 pounds of his rice for it.</p><p id="header-7-service" class="h2-header"> <a href="#top" style="font-size: 0.8em; text-decoration: none;">[^]</a> <span class="header-h2" style="color: #ca5804; font-size: 0.9em">Service:</span></p><p>The services a character renders-from those of the unskilled laborers to those of the prized engineers -all have their asking price.</p><p id="header-8-common-wages" class="h3-header"> <a href="#top" style="font-size: 0.8em; text-decoration: none;">[^]</a> <span class="header-h3" style="color: #ca5804; font-size: 0.8em">Common Wages</span></p><p>With both barter and service exchanges, the DM should make certain the goods or services exchanged are needed or desired.

These figures are for starting 3rd-level characters; characters starting at 1st-level should divide the total by three.

Whenever a successful attack inflicts maximum damage, there is a 1-in-20 chance that the weapon will break, as per the following example:</p><p>Bruth is sent to the arena armed with a bone battle axe against three unarmed gith. In his first round, Bruth cleaves through the skull of his first opponent (makes a successful attack) and brings him down (rolls an 8 on his 1d8 for damage). Unfortunately, the shock of the blow splinters the bone of the axe head (Bruth&#x27;s player rolls a 1 on 1d20 indicating weapon breakage), leaving him weaponless. Bruth&#x27;s career in the arena may be brief.</p><p id="header-14-armor" class="h1-header">IX.  <a href="#top" style="font-size: 0.8em; text-decoration: none;">[^]</a> <span style="color: #ca5804">Armor</span></p><p>All forms of armor listed in the<em>Player&#x27;s Hand-</em> <em>book</em>are available in Dark Sun.

A suit of field plate armor costs 2,000 gp on Athas, the equivalent of 5I 200,000 gp on other AD&amp;D®campaign worlds.</p>
<p>Simply put, a sorcerer-king can either purchase several suits of field plate or build a substantial addition to his city walls.</p><p>Likewise, the intense heat across Athas&#x27; barren surface makes metal armor an unpleasant experience, to say the least. In any daytime combat situation, a character wearing metal armor adds one to his THAC0 for every round of combat beyond the first and will collapse, exhausted from the heat, in a number of rounds equal to his Constitution score.</p><p id="header-16-alternate-materials" class="h2-header"> <a href="#top" style="font-size: 0.8em; text-decoration: none;">[^]</a> <span class="header-h2" style="color: #ca5804; font-size: 0.9em">Alternate Materials:</span></p><p>Many types of armor can be constructed without metal on Athas, using more readily available materials.</p><p id="header-17-shields" class="h2-header"> <a href="#top" style="font-size: 0.8em; text-decoration: none;">[^]</a> <span class="header-h2" style="color: #ca5804; font-size: 0.9em">Shields:</span></p><p>Shields are mostly constructed with layers of leather stretched over a wooden or bone frame and hardened.

The driver of the chariot must have either the teamster/ freighter secondary skill or the charioteering proficiency. The chariot driver can attack with single-handed weapons while the vehicle is moving, but suffers a -4 penalty to all attack rolls. Others in the vehicle suffer no penalty to melee attack rolls, but have a -1 penalty to missile attack rolls while the chariot is moving. Those in a chariot have 50% cover from the front or sides, 25% cover from the flank or rear (consult theDungeon Master&#x27;s Guide for the exact effects of cover and concealment on combat). If one of the animals hitched to a multikank chariot dies or is maimed, the chariot&#x27;s speed is reduced toI/3that of normal.

A normal howdah is made of a light wooden frame and has one seat for the animal&#x27;s driver. Normal howdahs do not count against the carrying capacity of the animal, but the driver&#x27;s weight does. A war howdah &#x27;is constructed of much sturdier materials, affording cover to those within. An inix war howdah weighs 150 pounds and can hold four fighters. A mekillot war howdah is a more elaborate affair, weighing 1,000 pounds. Within the mekillot war howdah&#x27;s two levels 16 warriors may ride, four of which can fight to any one side at a given time. Soldiers in a war howdah can choose to have 25%, 50%, 75%, or 30% coverandconcealment (consult theDungeon Master&#x27;s Guidefor the exact effects of cover and concealment on combat).

A 1,000pound-capacity wagon requires a single kank to pull it. The 2,500pound-and 5,000-pound-capacity wagons need teams of two and four kanks, respectively. The 10,000-pound-capacity requires a single mekillot to move.

The exact design of any particular armored caravan wagon can change from trip to trip. Artisans customize the interior for each journey, adding or taking away slave pens, expanding or removing enclosures, and so forth. In general, an armored war caravan can carry a cargo of 15,000 pounds of goods, plus have room for 50 fully armed warriors, 25 slaves in transit, and a handful of merchants, nobles, or other stately travelers. Soldiers in an armored caravan wagon can choose to have 25%, 50%, 75%, or 30% coverandconcealment (consult theDungeon Master&#x27;s Guidefor the exact effects of cover and concealment on combat). While one mekillot can pull an armored caravan wagon, they are usually drawn by a team of two, to prevent the death of a mount stranding the wagon.</p>

Inix trained for riding are also trained not to fight while mounted, for no rider could manage to keep his seat while an inix thrashed its mighty tail. Inix can be fitted with a howdah. Half-giants use them as individual mounts.

They are large insectoids, 4 feet high and 8 feet long, weighing around 400 pounds. As herd animals, kanks are durable and easily tended. Kanks are not raised for their meat, which becomes foul-smelling as soon as they die. Instead, they are raised for honey globules produced on their bellies. A single honey globule can bring 4 bits. As riding beasts, kanks provide effective transportation for a single character (except for halfgiants, who use inix for the same purpose). A kank can carry up to 400 pounds. Kanks used as riding animals also require harnesses and saddles. The tack and harness prices given in thePlayer&#x27;s Hand- bookfor horses work well for kanks also. Kanks can be hitched to wagons individually or in teams. A character needs the teamster/freighter secondary skill or the animal handling proficiency to effectively operate teams of kanks.</p><p id="header-44-mekillot" class="h3-header"> <a href="#top" style="font-size: 0.8em; text-decoration: none;">[^]</a> <span class="header-h3" style="color: #ca5804; font-size: 0.8em">Mekillot:</span></p><p>A mekillot is an enormous G-ton lizard, used as a beast of burden.
