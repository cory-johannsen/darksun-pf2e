In the calendar of Tyr, years are counted off using a pair of concurrently running cycles; one of eleven parts, the other of seven. The eleven-part, or <em>endlean</em>cycle, is counted and spoken first, in the order presented below. The seven-part, or<em>seofean</em> cycle, is counted and spoken second. The endlean cycle is complete when Athas&#x27; two moons, Ral and Guthay, meet in the heavens -a major eclipse that occurs once every 11 years. The seofean cycle is more abstract, meeting when agitation in the cosmos leads to fury. Every 77 years the cycle repeats itself, ending with a year of Guthay&#x27;s Agitation and starting again with a new year of Ral&#x27;s Fury. Each 77-year cycle is called a<em>king&#x27;s age;</em>there have been 183 complete king&#x27;s ages since Tyr adopted this calendar (more than 14,500 years). So, the first year of each king&#x27;s age is a year of Ral&#x27;s Fury. The next year is a year of Friend&#x27;s Contemplation, followed by a year of Desert&#x27;s Vengeance, etc. The 76th year of each king&#x27;s age is a year of Enemy&#x27;s Reverence, followed by the 77th year, a year of Guthay&#x27;s Agitation.</p><p id=\"header-1-the-endlean-cycle\" class=\"h1-header\">II.  <a href=\"#top\" style=\"font-size: 0.8em; text-decoration: none;\">[^]</a> <span style=\"color: #ca5804\">The Endlean Cycle</span></p><p id=\"header-2-the-seofean-cycle\" class=\"h1-header\">III.  <a href=\"#top\" style=\"font-size: 0.8em; text-decoration: none;\">[^]</a> <span style=\"color: #ca5804\">The Seofean Cycle</span></p><p>Fury Ral Friend Contemplation Desert Vengeance Slumber Priest Defiance Wind Dragon Reverence Mountain Agitation King Silt Enemy Guthay Superstition and folklore surrounds each of the years of the king&#x27;s age. Storms during a year of</p><p>Wind&#x27;s Vengeance are believed to be more powerful and dangerous, so many overland trips are avoided. Sacrifices and prayers are called for to ward off the great beast during years of Dragon&#x27;s Agitation. Years of Enemy&#x27;s Contemplation are supposed to enliven treaties and alliances-the list goes on. Each year is made up of exactly 375 days: the exact time between highest suns. Athasians have no seasons that govern their thinking of time-there is no marked difference in temperature or weather patterns. However, the year is divided into three equal phases: high sun, sun descending, and sun ascending. Highest sun is the first day of the year in the calendar of Tyr and lowest sun indicates the midpoint of the year (which, incidentally, occurs at midnight, and is generally observed in nighttime ceremonies). Days are kept track of in a variety of ways. Merchants tend to identify days with phrases such as &quot;thirty five days past the high sun.&quot; Other schemes divide the year into 25 weeks of 15 days each, the names of those days associated with important personages of a particular royal house. In DARK SUN campaigns, DMs may stick to seven day weeks with the standard Gregorian calendar names for simplicity.</p><p id=\"header-3-year-of-the-messenger\" class=\"h2-header\"> <a href=\"#top\" style=\"font-size: 0.8em; text-decoration: none;\">[^]</a> <span class=\"header-h2\" style=\"color: #ca5804; font-size: 0.9em\">Year of the Messenger</span></p><p>Every 45 years, a brilliant comet visits Athas.

Quite often in DARK SUN campaigns, characters will be in situations where the supply of water has no impact on the adventure. These dehydration rules are intended for extreme situations only and should only be enforced when a lack of water could be lifethreatening.</p><p id=\"header-6-water-consumption\" class=\"h2-header\"> <a href=\"#top\" style=\"font-size: 0.8em; text-decoration: none;\">[^]</a> <span class=\"header-h2\" style=\"color: #ca5804; font-size: 0.9em\">Water Consumption</span></p><p>How much water a character needs depends upon his level of activity and his race. An active character (hard exertion, walking, riding, etc.) needs 1 gallon of water per day. An inactive character (sitting, resting, or sleeping, etc.), needs ½ gallon of water per day. If the character is in the shade during the entire day, he only needs half the amount of water dictated by his activity. A character wearing a full suit of metal armor requires twice as much water each day to avoid dehydration. Thus, a character in metal armor who undertakes only light activity but is unable to remain in shaded areas would require 1 gallon of water. A character who does not drink enough water will suffer the effects of dehydration.</p><p id=\"header-7-unusual-races\" class=\"h3-header\"> <a href=\"#top\" style=\"font-size: 0.8em; text-decoration: none;\">[^]</a> <span class=\"header-h3\" style=\"color: #ca5804; font-size: 0.8em\">Unusual Races</span></p><p>Thri-kreen and half-giants suffer from dehydration differently than humans and normal demihumans.</p><p><span style=\"color: #ca5804\"><em>Thri-kreen:</em></span></p><p>Thri-kreen can go for one week on the amount of water it takes to sustain a human for one day.

In times of desperation, players may suggest more outlandish liquids to stave off dehydration: honey, tree sap, even the blood of fallen monsters. Generally, none of these are suitable substitutes.</p><p id=\"header-9-effects-of-dehydration\" class=\"h2-header\"> <a href=\"#top\" style=\"font-size: 0.8em; text-decoration: none;\">[^]</a> <span class=\"header-h2\" style=\"color: #ca5804; font-size: 0.9em\">Effects of Dehydration</span></p><p>A lack of water is reflected in the game by a reduction in Constitution.

When his family fails to pay the ransom, the elves turn him loose in the desert without food or water. His Constitution score is 15. After the first day without any water, he rolls a 3 on 1d6 bringing his Constitution temporarily down to 12. Since Thyasius is a 5th-level fighter, five of his hit points were due to his original Constitution of 15, so these are temporarily lost, as well. After a second day without water, Thyasius rolls 6 on 1d6, bringing his Constitution down to 6. Since the hit point adjustment for a character with a Constitution score of 6 is -1, he will temporarily lose another five hit points. After the third day, he rolls a 1, bringing his Constitution down to 5. Since the hit point modifier is still - 1, Thyasius loses no more hit points on the third day. On the fourth day, he is found by a half-elven trader who gives him a full gallon of water -- Thyasius&#x27; rolls 1d8 and regains 6 of his lost Constitution points. His lost hit points will return more slowly, in accordance with his normal healing rate.</p><p id=\"header-15-transporting-water\" class=\"h3-header\"> <a href=\"#top\" style=\"font-size: 0.8em; text-decoration: none;\">[^]</a> <span class=\"header-h3\" style=\"color: #ca5804; font-size: 0.8em\">Transporting Water</span></p><p>Water must be carried in skins or barrels.

If characters decide to travel by night, they gain the benefit of working in shade (half water consumption). The draw back to such plans is that good rest under the blistering sun of the day is difficult. Characters who are travelling by night must seek shelter during their daytime rest periods. Rock outcroppings or caves will suffice, as will tents or other make-shift buildings. If such shelter cannot be located, each character must make a save vs. poison in order to rest well. Those who fail will sleep fitfully and can not memorize spells or recover hit points. Thri-kreen obviously are not subject to this rule.</p><p id=\"header-18-overland-movement\" class=\"h1-header\">VIII.  <a href=\"#top\" style=\"font-size: 0.8em; text-decoration: none;\">[^]</a> <span style=\"color: #ca5804\">Overland Movement</span></p><p>The rules presented for overland travel in the Player&#x27;s Handbook and Dungeon Master&#x27;s Guide still govern movement on Athas.

On a roll of one, the mekillot stops where it is and won&#x27;t move further that day. On a roll of two, the mekillot takes a new direction, not given to it. Exactly when the mekillot becomes stubborn is determined randomly (roll 1d10 for the ten-hour march day). A stubborn mekillot can sometimes be controlled through magic or psionics. Any physical effort to change a mekillot&#x27;s mind (a beating, attempting to lure it with food, etc.) enrages it and causes it to attack. A mekillotcannotbe pushed to double or triple its normal movement.</p><p id=\"header-31-use-of-vehicles\" class=\"h2-header\"> <a href=\"#top\" style=\"font-size: 0.8em; text-decoration: none;\">[^]</a> <span class=\"header-h2\" style=\"color: #ca5804; font-size: 0.9em\">Use of Vehicles</span></p><p>Wagons, carts, and similarconveyances must be pulled by kanks, mekillots, or the like. A cart is any an wagon of less than 1,000 pounds capacity; carts generally have two wheels and can be drawn by one kank. Open, enclosed, and armored caravan wagons that require multiple draft animals also require a teamster to drive them-a teamster is any character with the animal handling proficiency. Wagons can be easily broken, especially when in difficult terrain. For every day of travel, a wagon has a 1% chance of breaking down (broken axle or wheel, the floor gives way, etc.). For every day of travel in rocky badlands, stony barrens, or mountain terrain, there is a 3% chance of breaking down. These chances are not cumulative with the passage of time. Broken wagons can be repaired by someone with the carpentry or engineering proficiency. A wagon moves at the speed of its beasts of burden. The animals cannot be pushed to double or triple their normal speed while pulling a wagon. Chariotsare just as described in the<em>DMG, ex-</em> cept that on Athas they are pulled by kanks. Kank teams of one, two, or four may be used that carry chariots holding no more than one, two, or three warriors, respectively. Chariots are more fragile and tend to break down during times of high speed and stress (such as combat). Use the wagon break down rates for day to day movement. However, in combat these same percentage chances apply per round, and are doubled if the chariot is turned more than 45 degrees while at high speeds. Howdahsare are small structures built for the backs of mekillots and inix. Having a howdah does not reduce the animal&#x27;s carrying capacity, and it can still move at double or triple rate, subject to the lameness and exhaustion rules in the<em>DMG.</em></p>",
